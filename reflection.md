- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
The Baby class represents a playful and curious baby character in a fictional, interactive environment. This baby can interact with toys, move around, and even “fly” by being lifted by an adult. I try to conform to Java naming conventions by making sure that the method name is consistent with the method actions. However, it is hard to brainstorm for the shrink() method especially for a baby. Here, I create new attributes—such as a cuteness level and speed—bring personality to the baby.



- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
* getToys(): Returns a list of all toys the baby currently holds. This helps check inventory without affecting the contents.
* getCutenessLevel(): Returns the current cuteness level of the baby, making it easy to retrieve this value for display or further actions.
* getPosition(): Returns the current position of the baby as a formatted string (x, y). This method helps track movement in the environment.
* getSpeed() and setSpeed(int speed): Allows retrieving and setting the baby's speed, directly affecting how far it moves in the walk() and fly() methods.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It was hard to override methods such as shrink to make sense for the class Baby(). However, a brainstorming session such as when we brainstormed the ATM helps to create relevant attributes and methods.
